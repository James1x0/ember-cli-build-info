# ember-cli-build-info

> Inject build info into your routes, controllers, and services.

*Note: this addon currently assumes you are using git for version control.*

Information includes:

```js
buildInfo: {
  version: '0.1.4', // pulled from package.json
  commit: '53df212', // from `desc` above
}
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-build-info
```

## Usage 
The data is injected into routes, controllers, and services using the `buildInfo` key.

In a template:
```html
<p>Version: {{buildInfo.version}}</p>
<p>SHA: {{buildInfo.commit}}</p>
```

In a route, controller, or service:
```js
var buildInfo = this.buildInfo;
```

## Configuration Options
There is currently a single configurable option. Customize using the `buildInfoOptions` hash in your Brocfile:

```js
var app = new EmberApp({
  buildInfoOptions: {
    metaTemplate: 'version={VERSION}'
  }
});
```

### `metaTemplate`
Allows you to inject a meta tag containing the build info. Defaults to `false`.

Available template keys include `{VERSION}` and `{COMMIT}`. These keys will be replaced by the current build info values.

The example above would yield:
```html
<meta name="build-info" content="version=0.0.2"/>
```
